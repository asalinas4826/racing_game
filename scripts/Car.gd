# Track vs. Race
# Does HUD depend on Track or Race?
# HUD will display laps, lap time

# audio?
# if music is different for every track, you'll want it to be in the track, but it's also synced w/ HUD
# sound effects should be in Player, actually

# using a race scene would also just be better organized and easier to look at, even if it's unnecessary

# start and end screens should be in race, as they should depend upon a higher-level game state
# if they were in track, then everything would have to be in track
